# Product Requirements Document: Minimal Pairs Pronunciation Drilling Feature

## Purpose

### Objective
Develop a self-evaluation pronunciation drilling feature that helps intermediate English learners improve their pronunciation accuracy through minimal pairs practice and audio comparison.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Intermediate English learners (B1-B2 level)
- **Secondary**: Upper-beginner learners transitioning to intermediate
- **Demographics**: Non-native English speakers aged 16-45, with basic English vocabulary but pronunciation challenges

### Problems Solved
- **Pronunciation confidence barrier**: Intermediate learners often avoid speaking due to pronunciation anxiety
- **Lack of pronunciation feedback**: Limited access to teachers or native speakers for pronunciation correction
- **Sound discrimination difficulties**: Inability to distinguish and produce similar English sounds
- **Self-awareness gap**: Learners don't recognize their own pronunciation errors

## Features

### Core Features
1. **Minimal Pairs Audio Library**: Pre-recorded native speaker audio for common problematic sound pairs
2. **Self-Recording System**: Browser-based audio recording functionality
3. **Audio Comparison Playback**: Sequential playback of original vs. user recordings
4. **Self-Evaluation Interface**: User-friendly scoring system for self-assessment
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and performance history
6. **Practice Session Management**: Structured practice sessions with multiple attempts

### Supporting Features
1. **Difficulty Levels**: Beginner-friendly to advanced minimal pairs
2. **Repeat Recording**: Multiple attempts per word/pair
3. **Slow Playback**: Adjustable playback speed for detailed analysis
4. **Session History**: Review previous recordings and improvements
5. **Offline Capability**: Core functionality works without internet connection

## Functionality

### User Flow
1. **Session Start**
   - User selects difficulty level or specific sound pair focus
   - System presents first minimal pair (e.g., "ship" vs "sheep")

2. **Learning Phase**
   - Play both words in the pair with clear audio cues
   - Display phonetic transcription and visual mouth position guides
   - User can replay as many times as needed

3. **Practice Phase**
   - User records first word ("ship")
   - System plays: Original → User Recording → Original
   - User self-evaluates (1-5 stars or "Try Again" vs "Sounds Good")
   - Repeat for second word ("sheep")

4. **Comparison Phase**
   - User records both words consecutively
   - System plays full comparison sequence
   - User provides final self-assessment for the pair

5. **Progress and Next**
   - System logs self-evaluation scores
   - Presents next minimal pair or session completion summary
