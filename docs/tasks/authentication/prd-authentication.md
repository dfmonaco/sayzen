# Product Requirements Document: User Authentication

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a user authentication
system for the SayZen application. The primary goal is to secure the
application, manage user access, and provide a personalized experience. The
system will be built using the Devise gem for Ruby on Rails and will support
two distinct user roles: `user` and `admin`.

## 2. Goals

*   **Secure Access:** Restrict access to specific content and features to
    authenticated users.
*   **User Personalization:** Allow users to create and manage their own
    accounts, enabling personalized experiences and content ownership.
*   **Role-Based Permissions:** Establish a clear distinction between general
    users and administrators to manage application access and functionality
    effectively.
*   **Foundation for Future Features:** Create a scalable authentication system
    that can support future development of user-centric features.

## 3. User Stories

*   **As a new user,** I want to sign up with my first name, last name, email,
    and a password so that I can create a personal account.
*   **As a registered user,** I want to sign in using my email and password so
    that I can access my account and protected content.
*   **As a logged-in user,** I want to sign out of the application to ensure my
    session is securely closed.
*   **As an administrator,** I want to have distinct permissions that grant me
    access to administrative functions, separate from regular users.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **User Registration (Sign Up):**
    *   The system must allow new users to create an account by providing their
        first name, last name, email address, and a password.
    *   The system must validate that the provided email address is unique and
        not already in use.
    *   The system must enforce a minimum password length to encourage stronger
        security.
2.  **User Authentication (Sign In/Sign Out):**
    *   The system must allow registered users to sign in using their email and
        password.
    *   Upon a failed login attempt, the system must display a generic error
        message (e.g., "Invalid email or password") without indicating which
        field was incorrect.
    *   The system must provide a mechanism for authenticated users to sign out.
3.  **User Roles:**
    *   The system must support two user roles: `user` (the default role for
        all new sign-ups) and `admin`.
    *   The application must be able to restrict access to specific features or
        pages based on these roles.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

The following features will not be included in the initial implementation:

*   Password recovery ("Forgot Password") functionality.
*   User account editing (e.g., allowing users to change their email or
    password).
*   "Remember Me" functionality for persistent sessions.
*   Third-party social logins (e.g., Google, GitHub).
*   Email confirmation or verification after registration.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   All authentication-related pages (Sign Up, Sign In) should adhere to the
    existing visual style and layout of the application.
*   Form validation errors should be displayed clearly and accessibly to the
    user.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   The authentication functionality will be implemented using the **Devise**
    Ruby gem.
*   A `role` attribute will be added to the `User` model to manage
    permissions. This can be implemented as a string or an integer/enum.

### 7.1. Testing Requirements

*   The most important functionality of the feature must be covered by tests.
*   This includes, but is not limited to: user registration, login, logout,
    and role-based access control.
*   The appropriate type of test (e.g., model, controller, integration)
    should be chosen for each specific piece of functionality to ensure it
    works as expected.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   The user registration, sign-in, and sign-out features are fully
    functional and bug-free.
*   Role-based access control is successfully implemented, and administrators
    can access areas that regular users cannot.
*   All tests related to the authentication feature must be passing.

## 9. Open Questions

*   What are the specific password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum
    length, required character types)?
*   What specific pages, features, or data should be restricted to the `admin`
    role?
