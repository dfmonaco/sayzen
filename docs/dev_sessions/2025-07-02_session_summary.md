# Development Session Summary - 2025-07-02

This session focused on building a new landing page with integrated authentication modals, adhering to strict BEM and StimulusJS conventions.

## Key Learnings & Actions:

### CSS Implementation & BEM Methodology

- **Strict Adherence to Directives:** Successfully implemented a BEM-based CSS architecture, creating component-specific stylesheets in `app/assets/stylesheets/components/`.
- **Tailwind Token Usage:** Overcame significant challenges with Tailwind's `theme()` function.
  - **Resolution:** Established a hybrid approach:
    - Use standard CSS variables (`var(--primary-color)`) for colors, defined in `:root`.
    - Use the `theme()` function for all other design tokens (spacing, fonts, etc.) to leverage Tailwind's default theme.
- **Hardcoded Value Removal:** Refactored the CSS to use CSS variables for color opacity instead of hardcoded `rgba()` values, improving maintainability.

### Stimulus & Turbo Streams Integration

- **Stimulus Controller Scoping:** Debugged and resolved an issue where modal actions were not firing.
  - **Resolution:** Moved the `data-controller="modal"` attribute to the `<body>` tag in the application layout to ensure the controller's scope included the header buttons.
- **Devise Form Validations:** Implemented a robust solution for handling Devise validation errors within the modals using Turbo Streams.
  - **Initial Problem:** Failed submissions caused a full page reload, losing the modal state.
  - **Resolution:**
    1.  Created custom Devise `RegistrationsController` and `SessionsController`.
    2.  The controllers now respond to `turbo_stream` requests on validation failure.
    3.  The response re-renders the modal partial (e.g., `_signup_modal.html.erb`) with the `resource.errors` and an `open: true` local variable to ensure the modal remains visible with the error messages.
- **Redirects with Turbo:** Addressed the common pitfall of redirects not working as expected after a successful Turbo Stream form submission.
  - **Resolution:** Added `target: "_top"` to the `turbo_frame_tag` wrapping the modals. This forces a full-page redirect to the dashboard upon successful login or signup, allowing flash messages to be displayed correctly.

### Rails Best Practices

- **View Refactoring:** Broke down the monolithic landing page view into well-structured partials for the header, footer, and modals (`_header.html.erb`, `_footer.html.erb`, etc.).
- **Devise Helpers on Non-Devise Pages:** Successfully rendered Devise forms on the `HomeController` by defining the required `resource`, `resource_name`, and `devise_mapping` helpers.
- **System Testing:** Built a comprehensive system test suite (`landing_page_test.rb`) to validate the entire user flow, including modal interactions, authentication, and dynamic header changes.

## Next Steps:

- The `feature/landing-page` branch is complete and ready for review.
- Future work could include implementing the mobile menu functionality and revisiting the `tailwind.config.js` issue to enable the use of `theme()` for colors.
