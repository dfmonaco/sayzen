# Development Session Summary - 2025-06-30

This session focused on setting up the Progressive Web App (PWA)
foundation and resolving related issues.

## Key Learnings & Actions:

### Git Workflow Adherence

- **Commit Message Quoting:** Encountered and resolved issues with shell
  command execution due to unquoted backticks in `git commit -m` messages.
  
  - **Resolution:** Established the practice of always enclosing commit
    messages in single quotes (`'...'`) to prevent shell interpretation
    of special characters.

- **Feature Branching:** Corrected workflow to create a dedicated feature
  branch (`feature/pwa-foundations`) for new feature development, adhering
  to the project's Git branching model.

### PWA Foundation Setup

- **Manifest Configuration:** Configured `app/views/pwa/manifest.json.erb`
  with essential PWA properties, including `name`, `icons`, `start_url`,
  `display`, `scope`, `description`, `theme_color`, and `background_color`.

- **Service Worker Implementation:** Implemented a basic service worker
  (`app/views/pwa/service-worker.js.erb`) for asset caching.
  
  - **Key Fix:** Resolved `addAll` cache errors by using Rails' `asset_path`
    helper within the `.js.erb` file to correctly reference fingerprinted
    CSS and JavaScript assets.

- **Integration:** Ensured the manifest is linked in
  `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` and the service worker is
  registered in `app/javascript/application.js`.

- **Routing:** Enabled PWA-specific routes in `config/routes.rb` for the
  manifest and service worker files.

### Debugging JavaScript Loading Issues

- **Development Server Setup:** Discovered that running `bin/rails s`
  manually without `foreman` (or `bin/dev`) did not correctly orchestrate
  the JavaScript and CSS build processes.
  
  - **Resolution:** Confirmed that running the development environment
    via `foreman -f Procfile.dev` (which starts `rails server`, `yarn build --watch`,
    and `yarn build:css --watch` concurrently) is essential for proper
    asset compilation and serving in development.

### PWA Manifest Warnings & Errors

- **Missing Screenshots:** Addressed warnings about missing screenshots for
  a richer PWA install UI by adding placeholder `screenshots` entries to
  `manifest.json.erb` for both `wide` (desktop) and `narrow` (mobile)
  form factors.

- **Missing `id` Field:** Resolved a warning by adding the `id` field to
  `manifest.json.erb`, setting it to `/` to match the `start_url` and
  ensure consistent PWA identity.

## Next Steps:

- TBD on next session
