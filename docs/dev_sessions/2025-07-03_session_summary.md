# Development Session Summary - 2025-07-03

This session focused on refining existing features, improving code quality, and addressing technical debt related to the landing page and authentication modals.

## Key Actions & Refactorings:

### Git Workflow & PR Preparation
- Reviewed and committed pending work, including CSS refactoring and new landing page features.
- Created a `create_pr.sh` script to automate GitHub pull request creation with a comprehensive description based on the branch's diff and commit history.

### CSS Refactoring & Best Practices
- Refactored button size classes in `app/assets/stylesheets/components/button.css` from implementation-specific (`.btn--h-10`, `.btn--h-11`, `.btn--h-12`) to semantic names (`.btn--sm`, `.btn--md`, `.btn--lg`). Corresponding HTML files were updated.
- Implemented a new flash messages component with BEM-compliant CSS (`app/assets/stylesheets/components/flash.css`) and updated `app/views/shared/_flash_messages.html.erb` to apply these styles.
- Discussed and reinforced adherence to CSS directives, particularly regarding semantic naming and mobile-first approach.

### JavaScript (StimulusJS) Refactoring
- Refactored `app/javascript/controllers/modal_controller.js` to be more generic and reusable across the application.
  - Removed `static targets` and now relies on `id` attributes for modal elements, located via `this.element.querySelector`.
  - Introduced private helper methods (`_showModal`, `_hideModal`) to centralize modal display and hiding logic, reducing code duplication.
  - Updated all corresponding HTML files to use `data-modal-id` and `data-switch-target` attributes instead of old `id`s for modal interaction.

### Bug Fixes & Code Cleanup
- Fixed duplicated IDs on form inputs (`#new_user`, `#user_email`, `#user_password`) within the login and signup modals by adding unique prefixes (`login_user_email`, `signup_user_email`, etc.) in `_login_modal.html.erb` and `_signup_modal.html.erb`.
- Updated system tests in `test/system/landing_page_test.rb` to use the new, explicit input IDs, resolving test failures caused by the ID changes.
- Removed unused modal opening logic from `app/controllers/home_controller.rb`, as this functionality is now handled by Turbo Streams in the Devise controllers.

### Technical Discussions
- Explored the functionality and necessity of `target: "_top"` in `turbo_frame_tag` for successful authentication redirects versus Turbo Stream updates for failed validations.
- Compared the benefits of `turbo_frame_tag` over traditional `remote: true` (Rails UJS) for dynamic interactions.
- Reviewed the `configure_permitted_parameters` method in `ApplicationController` and its role in Devise's strong parameters.

## Next Steps:
- Continue with any remaining tasks for the landing page feature or move on to new features as per project plan.
